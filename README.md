# Pull request dashboard for Github

This dashboard is available at [pull-requests.connorlanigan.com](https://pull-requests.connorlanigan.com).

It shows you a list of the organisations and teams that you have access to on GitHub, and a list of the open pull requests in the repositories of each of these organisations and teams.

It queries the GitHub API directly from your browser. Your personal access token is stored only in your browser's local storage.

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
